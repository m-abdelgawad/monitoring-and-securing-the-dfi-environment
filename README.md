<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![cover]

* Project Name: Monitoring and Securing the DFI Environment
* Version: v1.0.0
* Organization Department: Technology

### Description

I performed an analysis of "Windows server 2016" and "Linux (CentOS) server" 
using Defense in Depth principles as well as the concept of Least Privilege and provided 
a report of any recommendations on OS hardening, compliance issues, 
encryption, and network security.

I also recommended mitigation steps from my analysis of firewall reports 
(and new connections) in the form of creating sample firewall rules. 
Similarly, I analyzed threat intelligence and crafted sample IDS signatures. 
I also encrypted several files and folders in preparation for transport to a client.

> This project was a milestone in my journey to study the Introduction 
to Cybersecurity Nanodegree provided by Udacity.

#### Project Overview

Douglas Financials Inc (DFI from here forward) has experienced successful 
growth and, as a result, is ready to add a Security Analyst position. 
Previously Information Security responsibilities fell on our System 
Administration team. Due to compliance and the growth of DFI, 
we are happy to bring you on as our first InfoSec employee! Once you are 
settled in and finished orientation, we have your first 2-Weeks assignments ready.

Week 1: Your first set of tasks is to perform an analysis of 
"Windows server 2016" and "Linux (CentOS) server" using Defense in 
Depth principles as well as the concept of Least Privilege and provide 
a report of any recommendations on OS hardening, compliance issues, 
encryption, and network security.

Week 2: You'll next be asked to recommend mitigation steps from your 
analysis of firewall reports (and new connections) in the form of creating 
sample firewall rules. Similarly, you'll analyze threat intelligence and 
craft sample IDS signatures. You'll also encrypt several files and folders 
in preparation for transport to a client.
